# My Personal Set of dotfiles (Arch btw)
A nice and minimal setup with a very utilitarian theme. All monochrome because its really nice.

## How could I go about and use these?
Read [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/jumpyjacko/dotfiles/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

## Window manager
I use dwm for this, it is at [this repository](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/dwm).
I also use my fork of thytom/dwmbar at [this repository](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/dwmbar).

## Neovim
I use [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) with my configs at [this repository](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/astronvim_user).
