# My Personal Set of dotfiles (Arch btw)
A nice and minimal setup with a very utilitarian theme. All monochrome because its really nice.

## Prerequisites
- Mononoki Nerd Font
- dwmbar
- feh
- zsh
- neovim
- alacritty
- firefox
- exa
- neofetch

Notes:
It is required that X11 is used, I can't be bothered with wayland and I just used the `archinstall` script and picking the `xorg` option at the end of the install.

## Window manager
I use dwm for this, it is at [this repository](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/dwm).

## Commands to run
Get and run `install.sh` script. (Requires no input until end of script where `paru` is being compiled)
```sh
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JumpyJacko/dotfiles/main/install.sh && sudo bash -x ./install.sh
```
